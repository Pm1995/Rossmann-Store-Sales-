# Rossmann-Store-Sales-

## Overview 
Rossmann is Germany's second-largest drug store chain, with over 3,600 stores in Europe. 
Like any other retail chain,  Rossmann’s store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality.
In their first Kaggle competition, Rossmann has issued a challenge to predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Accurate results would help Rossmann managers make data driven business decisions. 

## Data Fields 
Rossman has issued two data sets for analysis namely Store and Train.
Both the data frames have STORE ID column which is unique to every store.
The Store data frame has variables like competition distance and store type etc
Train data frame contains the SALES target variable as well as the number of customers in each store.
